<h1>
    Web is designed for purchasing sneakers
</h1>
<p>
    The business we are proposing to open is a high end sneaker store by the name of Laced Up.The major product in our
    store will be exclusive sneakers. Our two biggest brands will be Nike and Jordan. Exclusive Nike and Jordans will be
    in stock all the time and these exclusive shoes will bring in many customers as there is a huge market for them.
    This will not just be a footlocker or a champs we will be a one of a kind store . We will also have various brands
    of clothing in men, womens and childrens sizes. The clothing that we keep in stock will also be high end athletic
    apparel including Nike, UnderArmour, Adidas, etc. This clothing will bring in customers even if they are not looking
    for a pair of sneakers. We will also have a program where customers will be able to sell sneakers to use that we
    will buy and then sell in store. The sneakers that we buy will have to be in brand new condition and we will reseal
    them. The used sneakers will be cheaper then the new pair and also will look just as good.
